_Go, TypeScript, SQL, Gin, React, Docker, PostgreSQL_

Implemented Agent/Master architecture to gather, store and monitor system resource metrics via APIs.

- **Agent** service collects **CPU, RAM, SSD, and Network metrics** and sends them to the **Master**.
- **Master** service to **receive, aggregate, and store metrics** in **PostgreSQL database**.
- Exposed Master's **HTTP routes** for **serving metrics** to a **React dashboard**.
- **Microservice architecture** with **gRPC-based** communication.
